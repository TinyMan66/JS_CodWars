/*Task:
A Narcissistic Number is a number of length l in which the sum of its digits to the power of l is equal to the original number. 
If this seems confusing, refer to the example below.

Write a function that, given n, returns whether or not n is a Narcissistic Number.*/


function isNarcissistic(n) {
  let arr = [...n.toString()]; // number to String and to array of Strings
  
  let arrNum = arr.map(Number); // array of Strings to array of numbers
  
  /* raising each element of the numbers array to a power equal to the number of digits in the n. 
  further addition of numbers and comparison with the n.*/
  
  return arrNum.map((num) => num ** String(n).length).map(i => x += i, x = 0).reverse()[0] == n ? true : false;
}
