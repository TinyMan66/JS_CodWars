/*Task: You can print your name on a billboard ad. Find out how much it will cost you. 
Each character has a default price of Â£30, but that can be different if you are given 2 parameters instead of 1.
You can not use multiplier "*" operator.*/

function billboard(name, price = 30){
  return Math.round(Math.exp(Math.log(name.length) + Math.log(price)));
}
